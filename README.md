STEPS :
=======
 -Upload serial.ino to arduino first for all projects to be performed. <br />
 
 -Change PORT Number according to your Connected usb port of arduino. <br />
 
 -Change Push Bullet API Key before using it (If there is in Program). <br />
 
 -Connect an LED to pin 13 of arduino and ground pin. <br /> 
 
 -APK used in Sending sensor data to arduino is free sensor node.apk you can find it on google play store <br />
